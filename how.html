        <p><b>Radiation Shielding:</b> Our cutting-edge materials and technologies will protect astronauts from Jupiter’s
            intense radiation. Utilizing innovative shielding techniques and magnetic fields, we ensure maximum safety
            for our crew.
            <br><br>
            <b>Robust Life Support Systems:</b> Our state-of-the-art life support systems are designed to sustain human life
            for extended periods. These systems efficiently recycle air, water, and food, ensuring reliability and
            sustainability throughout the mission.
