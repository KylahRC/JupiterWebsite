            <p class="paragraphHeaders">Radiation Exposure</p>
            <p> <b>Jupiter’s Magnetic Field:</b> Jupiter has a very strong magnetic field that traps high levels of
                radiation. This radiation can be extremely harmful to humans, causing serious health issues such as
                cancer and acute radiation sickness. </p>
        </div> <br>
        <div class="paragraphBlocks">
            <p class="paragraphHeaders">Extreme Gravity</p>
            <p> <b>Cardiovascular Strain:</b> While the idea is to strengthen bones and muscles, the intense gravity
                could also cause severe strain on the cardiovascular system, making it difficult for the heart to pump
                blood effectively. This could lead to cardiovascular problems and other health issues. </p>
        </div> <br>
        <div class="paragraphBlocks">
            <p class="paragraphHeaders">Spacecraft Design and Safety</p>
            <p> <b>Engineering Challenge:</b> Designing a spacecraft that can withstand the harsh conditions near
                Jupiter, including its strong radiation belts and intense gravitational pull, would be a massive
                engineering challenge. Ensuring the safety and well-being of the crew in such an environment would
                require advanced technology and significant resources. </p>
        </div> <br>
        <div class="paragraphBlocks">
            <p class="paragraphHeaders">Psychological Effects</p>
            <p> <b>Mental Health:</b> Prolonged isolation and confinement in a spacecraft, far from Earth, can have
                serious psychological effects on astronauts. This includes stress, anxiety, and potential mental health
                issues due to the extreme environment and isolation. </p>
        </div> <br>
        <div class="paragraphBlocks">
            <p class="paragraphHeaders">Logistics and Cost</p>
            <p> <b>Mission Expense:</b> The mission would be incredibly expensive and logistically complex. It would
                require significant advancements in space travel technology, life support systems, and radiation
                shielding, among other things. </p>
        </div> <br>
        <div class="paragraphBlocks">
            <p class="paragraphHeaders">Return to Earth</p>
            <p> <b>Readjustment:</b> After experiencing heightened gravity, returning to Earth’s lower gravity might not
                result in “super strength.” Instead, the body might need time to readjust, and there could be potential
                complications from the sudden change in gravitational forces. </p>
